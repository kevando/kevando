I love using my imagination. When facts and figures enter the picture, I typically lose interest. I like possibility, not certainty. If you want certainty, read the dictionary. If you want possibility, watch videos on Liveleak.

`Knowledge is the enemy of imagination`

I learn so much from digging lots of rabbit holes, too. Many of them do not look similar at the surface, but the deeper you dig, similarites start to emerge and you can see it's just "Big Brother" again. The real value comes not from digging down, but from digging up. It's when I see the light that I'm reminded how crazy things were down there. And how people's concerns can be misplaced and valid at the same time. (ie: your phone does not listen to you. it's much worse than that). But at the end of the day, it all comes down to belief. What do you believe? Do aliens exist? Sure is plenty of convincing evidence. But all the evidence  has also been convincingly refuted, too. That means I have to choose whether or not I believe in aliens, a rather profound thought. Is all belief a choice? I think so.
